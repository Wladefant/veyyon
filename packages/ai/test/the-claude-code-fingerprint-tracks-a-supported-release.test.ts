/**
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS.
 *
 * The Anthropic OAuth wire carries a Claude Code version in three places: the `cc_version` field of the
 * `x-anthropic-billing-header` system block, the `claude-cli/<version>` user-agent, and the
 * `claude-code/<version>` OAuth bootstrap user-agent. `/v1/messages` reads that version and rejects the
 * request when it is older than the minimum a requested model requires:
 *
 *     400 invalid_request_error, error_code=claude_code_version_too_old
 *     "Claude Code <sent> does not support this model; version <minimum> or newer is required."
 *
 * The failure is total for the affected models and it arrives with no local symptom beforehand: the constant
 * is valid, every internal assertion about it passes, and the request is well formed. It goes stale by the
 * calendar rather than by an edit, so nothing in this repository moves when it breaks.
 *
 * THE CLASS THIS CLOSES. A fingerprint version that sits below a minimum the API has already been observed to
 * enforce, and an `agent-sdk/<version>` that stops tracking the CLI release it is paired with. Both are
 * static facts about the constants, so both are checkable without a network call.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH. The floor is the newest minimum the API has been seen to enforce, not the one it
 * enforces today. When Anthropic raises the minimum again, these cases stay green and the request still
 * fails 400 — the raised floor is recorded here as part of that fix. Nor does this suite prove the version
 * reaches the wire; `anthropic-alignment.test.ts` asserts the emitted billing header and user-agents, and
 * `claude-code-identity-has-one-owner.test.ts` proves there is exactly one copy of the constant to bump.
